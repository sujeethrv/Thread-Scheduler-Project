# Thread-Scheduler-Project

## Overview
This project involves implementing a thread scheduler in C, using the pthreads library for a system with a single CPU and two IO devices. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in multithreading, synchronization mechanisms, and CPU scheduling policies. This project was completed as a part of Operating Systems Course at Penn State.

## Key Features
- Implementation of pthreads for multithreaded programming.
- Utilization of synchronization tools like locks, condition variables, and semaphores.
- Design of various CPU scheduling policies, particularly Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).

## How to Run
- Clone the repository.
- Compile using `make`.
- Execute with an input file, e.g., `./proj2 task_inputs/input_1`.
